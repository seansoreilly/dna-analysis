# DNA Health Analysis Tool - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Build a simple, privacy-first DNA analysis tool that parses personal genomic data and uses LLM to explain health-related genetic variants in plain English.

## Core Requirements

### 1. DNA File Parser
- Parse 23andMe and Ancestry raw DNA files
- Extract SNP data (rsID, genotype, chromosome, position)
- Handle standard tab-delimited formats
- Validate file format and completeness

### 2. Health SNP Database
- Curate list of ~50 well-studied health-related SNPs
- Focus areas: cardiovascular health, metabolism, drug response, nutrition
- Store SNP information: gene name, rsID, health trait, phenotypes
- Include allele information and expected health implications

### 3. Variant Annotation Integration
- Query public APIs (MyVariant.info) for variant annotations
- Retrieve scientific information about user's specific variants
- Cache results to minimize API calls
- Handle API errors gracefully

### 4. LLM Explanation Engine
- Use Claude API to interpret genetic variants
- Convert variant data into plain English explanations
- Generate personalized health insights based on user's genotype
- Explain what variants mean for health traits without medical diagnosis

## Privacy & Safety
- All DNA processing happens locally on user's machine
- Raw DNA data never uploaded to external services
- Only annotated variant information sent to LLM
- Include clear disclaimers that this is not medical advice

## Success Criteria
- Successfully parse 23andMe/Ancestry DNA files
- Look up ~30+ variants from user's DNA
- Provide clear, understandable explanations of health implications
- Tool runs end-to-end without errors on sample data
